# Digital Fabrication

This is a collection of my notes, practicals, presentations on Digital Fabrication.

Here is a quick site link:

- [EP1000 Digital Fabrication](https://rdorville.github.io/EP1000) which is the main notes page
- [Presentations](presentations/presentations.md) which will host most of the presentations
- [Practicals](practicals/practicals.md) which should hold the various practicals that I have written.

Enjoy!
