# Workflow

- Start with a **digital model** of the project
- Obtain 2D profiles of items to cut
- Finalize layout and enhancements
	- cut lines are **Vectors**
	- enhancements/engravings are **Raster**
- Send for Computer Controlled Cutting
	- Laser cutting & engraving
	- Vector controlled knife
	- 2D/2.5D flatbed router

# Laser Cutting

- Process where material is placed in X-Y plane and a LASER is moved across the profile to be cut
- Light Amplification by Simulated Emission of Radiation
- Laser is focused to a tight spot, beam "cuts" (ionizes material) at that spot
- Moving the Laser cuts the material.
- Laser beam is continuous or pulsed.

# Controlling the Cut

### The "**CUT**" is controlled by

- Speed of the movement of the laser
	- Slow speeds, more intense vaporisation, deeper cuts
	- Slow speeds cause charring of material
- Power (intensity) of the laser
	- Higher intensities produce deeper cuts
	- Higher intensities are required for more dense material
- Frequency of pulsation
	- Most lasers are pulsed
	- Higher pulsing rates are required for denser material
		- Acrylic 600-800 ppm
		- Wood 200-300 ppm

### Performing "test" cuts of 20x20mm are recommended.

---


# Recommendations

- Each system comes with a set of recommendations e.g. [Epilog Laser Material Settings](https://www.epiloglaser.com/assets/downloads/fusion-material-settings.pdf)

<div width="100%" height="100px">
	<img src="epilog_material_settings.png" >
</div>

- Use the recommendations as a **starting** point
- Rule-of-thumb:
	- Never use 100% Power
	- Observe the cutting process
	- Look out for "Best Practices"

---

# Materials

### What you can cut:
- Ref: ([Epilog Laserable Materials](https://www.epiloglaser.com/how-it-works/laser-material-compatibility.htm))
- Acrylic
- Paper products
- Wood (preferably not MDF)
- Leather

### What you should **NOT** cut:
- [Never Cut These Materials](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=laser+%22never+cut+these+materials%22&t=canonical&ia=web)
- Samples
	- PVC emits chlorine gas
	- Polycarbonate cuts poorly, discolors, catches fie
	- ABS emits cyanide gas, melts
	- Polystyrene foam catches fire and melts
	- Fiberglass emits fumes
	- Metals (cannot be cut with a CO2 laser)

---

# Preparing Your Design

- You require a 2D (Vector) profile 
	- DXF (AutoCAD Data eXchange Format)
	- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
	- PDF (Portable Document Format)
- The cut (Vector) lines are converted to "hairline" or < 0.1 mm
- All other profile objects are treated as engravings (Raster)
- The profile is sent to the Laser using a Printer Driver
- The Laser cutting software takes over
	- proprietary to each laser system
		- [Epilog](https://www.epiloglaser.com/tech-support/epilog-drivers.htm)
		- [Universal Laser Systems](https://www.ulsinc.com/support/software-downloads)
		- [RDWorks](https://www.thunderlaser.com/laser-download)
	- requires orientation/practice for each system
	- workflow is similar

---

# Engraving

- An engraving is a profile that instructs the laser to "mark" the material
- "Laser Marking" causes the laser light to etch, engrave, mark the material without cutting through
- Can be used to create
	- graphics (Logos, symbols, photographs)
	- text
	- cosmetic features
- Added at the time of cutting
- Similar to Inkjet/Laser printing on paper
- Controlled using laser software
	- at a lower power
	- usually color-coded
- In operation, engraving is done before the cut

# Kerf

<div width="90%" height="100%">
	<img src="kerf.png" width="auto" height="320px" >
</div>

- amount of material removed in the cutting process
- can be fine-tuned using laser cutting parameters
- approximately 0.2~0.8 mm
- for place-fit cutting, adjustments are made to compensate for kerf
	- "holes" made smaller
	- "tabs" made larger

# Creating your "Cut" Profile

### Any 2D profile
- convert line widths to hairline (or < 0.1mm)
- convert engravings to color (RGB) intensities
- send to Laser software

### 3D profiles/models
- select the 2D plane profile
- export the profile as DXF, SVG or PDF
- work the 2D profile

### We want to cut & decorate the 2D profile (front of box)

### Create a NEW (2D) sketch on the plane of the object
### Save the Sketch

# Obtaining DXF profiles from Fusion 360 -4

[<img src="04_export_dxf.png" alt="Export to DXF" style="height:360px;"/>](04_export_dxf.png)

### Export the sketch to a DXF file

### Check it!

# Checking your 2D profiles

[<img src="05_check_dxf.png" alt="Check and Layout DXF" style="height:360px;"/>](05_check_dxf.png)

### Use LibreCAD, Inkscape, CorelDraw, Illustrator

### Can also layout your cuts before you come to FabLab

---

# Preparation for Laser Cutting using CorelDraw

### Coreldraw

- the preferred software (licensed)
- handles both vector and raster graphics
- sends the output to the Laser cutter using a printer driver

### Workflow

- Open Coreldraw, select "New", check paper size
- File > Import
	- DXF, PDF, SVG
	- Coreldraw file (.CDR) (version important)
- Layout your cut profiles
	- use guides
	- convert cut lines to hairlines (RED/BLACK)
	- add engraving graphics (RGB colors)
	- send for printing

---

# CorelDraw TouchUp

[<img src="06_coreldraw_enhancements.png" alt="Coreldraw Enhancements" style="height:360px;"/>](06_coreldraw_enhancements.png)

- Check cut lines are hairlines
- Add raster graphics/decorations
- Use colors (RGB) to define raster/vector operations
- Send layout to Laser cutter using "**PRINT**"

---

# ULS Lasercutting software

[<img src="ULS_control_software.png" alt="ULS Control Software" style="height:360px;"/>](ULS_control_software.png)

- Access to materials database

---

# ULS Workflow:

- Open ULS software, it should show the cut/engrave profile
- Use settings to change
	- Laser parameters based on color
	- Raster (engrave) before Vector (cut) processing
- Layout and position items to cut
- Perform test cut / Examine extremities of cut
- Close cover and cut (GO)

- absolute positioning using data input

---

# Move Cut Profile to Pointer Position

[<img src="ULS_02_move_object.png" alt="ULS Move Object" style="height:360px;"/>](ULS_02_move_object.png)

### Position profile
