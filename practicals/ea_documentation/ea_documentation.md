## Background

We have covered the following in the morning session:

- Why we need to document
- An introduction HTML and CSS
- Webpage hosting on GitHub
- Version control using Git
- Markdown as an alternative to HTML

&nbsp;

## Task

You are required to complete the following to show that you have an understanding of the importance and need for good documentation.

1. Create a website with at least **3** pages

    1. **Home Page** - with an introduction of what your site intends to host and a brief outline of its contents e.g. Documentation of my projects, experiences, skills-learnt, mistakes made, new technical products

    2. **Project Page(s)** - documenting your experience with HTML, CSS, GitHub, Git and/or Markdown.  How you setup your site etc.  One good example is to document how you use Github Desktop to archive your site, with co-relations to the actual Git commands.

    3. **About** - an about page telling the world about yourself.  Please leave out confidential data e.g Your birthday, NRIC or bank details.  Make it interesting so that a reader would want to follow your exploits!

2. Demonstrate the following WWW characteristics:

    1. A uniform look across all pages

    2. Navigation from the Home Page to the other pages

    3. Should incorporate

        - A common header, footer and navigation
        - Images and side-by-side text
        - Links and references
        - A way to contact you through social media e.g. email, etc

3. Place all your images (photos, drawings, screenshots) in a folder names "images" to separate it from the rest of your web-pages.

4. Host your website on Github using the project-name **engacad**.

5. Use Git to manage your web-site

## Tips

1. If you are using Windows, make sure that all your filenames, urls, links follow the following rules:
  - do not mix upper and lower case, try to use **ONLY** lower case as far as possible.
  - do not have spaces, use underscores "\_" or hypens "-"

2. You can develop your webpage using

  - raw HTML and CSS by developing your own template

  - Jake Wright's template from "Learn CSS in 12 minutes"

  - Markdown

3. If you need help, drop me a note on Telegram: [**RodneyD_SG**](https://t.me/RodneyD_SG), I'll get back to you asap.&lt; br&gt;
